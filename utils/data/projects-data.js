        description: 'Engineered a three-phase automation pipeline to handle judge–poster assignment, scoring, and final ranking for Syracuse University’s ECS Research Day. Scraped faculty web pages using BeautifulSoup to collect research interests for NLP-based matching. Applied NLP techniques (BERT embeddings, cosine similarity, TF-IDF vectorization) to match judges with an 85%+ semantic relevance score.',
